Hexen II for Dreamcast

	BERO <bero@geocities.co.jp>

- you should set joypad config in options/customize control before starting game.

Status

 - working glhexen2 only (because hexen2 soft render use x86 asm code)
 - transpalency bug
 - full control using pad (except console) , and mouse,keyboard support
 - sound
 - save to visual memory with zlib compression and icon
 - cd-da music (but disabled -- if you read data from pc using dcload-ip and cd-da from cd, work fine)
 - no network
 - no midi music
 - I don't have commercial version, so demo version data file only tested.

How to run

- it runs CD-R or CD-ROM, dcload-ip with this directory structure:

burned Hexen II demo version:
\Hexen II Demo
  +- data1
       +- glhexen (optional*)
       +- PAK0.PAK

burned Hexen II commercial version full install:
\Hexen II (??)
  +- data1
  |    +- glhexen (optional*)
  |    +- PAK0.PAK
  |    +- PAK1.PAK
  |    +- shots/hexenXX.pcx or hexenXX.tga (optional)
  +- other mod (optional)
  +- other mod (optional)
  +- games.lst (optional)

(*) glhexen directory is genarated when you run glh2 on PC, 
 or mkdir by hand and run under dcload-ip.
 if this directory exist, loading faster.

IMPORTANT:
 latest commercial version and demo version glhenxen directory format is different.
 DC version is same as latest commercial version.
 if you run demo version on PC, you must delete glhexen directory. othersize you look broken object.

Hexen II commercial version CD-ROM:
 I don't know this structure, so not support.


dcload-ip:

same as burned image but on pc harddrive.
if Hexen II directory is at C:\Hexen II Demo, under cygwin enviroment, 
$ mount -b 'C:\Hexen II Demo' /hexen2
and
$ dcload-ip -t <dreamcast ip> glhexen2.elf


Add mod/map/TC

I don't test yet
I suggest you run under dcload-ip before burning.

1. Intall/Extract in Hexen II directory.
2. read it's document
3. make "games.lst" in Hexen II directory

example
--cut--
#gamename,dir,cmdline,screenshot,txt
Hexen II,data1,,hexen00.pcx,
After the Fall,atf,,hexen00.pcx,atf.txt
--cut--

if cmdline is only "-game dirname" then you can omit cmdline.
To make screenshot, run under dcload-ip and press F12 on DC keyboard, or run (gl)h2 on PC with 320x200 or 320x240 resolution.

- Hexen II Demo version Data files have another Licence.
